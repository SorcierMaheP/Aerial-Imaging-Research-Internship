So far various attention mechanisms have been introduced to improve performance of CNNs. SE-Net created a method for extracting channel information. ECA-Net presented an efficient algorithm for channel attention with relatively good performance. CBAM mixed channel attention with spatial attention to enhanmce features in two separate dimensions.  HyP-ECA enhanced the results of ECA-Net and introduced it to YOLOv8 to improve detection of smaller objects.  
## CBAM
The CBAM attention process works as follows: First the input feature map is is enhanced by the channel
